<h1>Knight's Tavern Order System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project simulates an interaction between the owner of a tavern and a knight who, along with his convoy, is seeking food and drink. The program prompts the knight for his name and a characteristic, greets him, and provides food and drink options, including kebab, lasagna, mac and cheese, chicken pasta, and vodka. The knight is then asked how many of each item he requires for his party. The program calculates the subtotal cost of the ordered items, adds taxes, and presents the total cost, including taxes, to the knight. Finally, it ends with a polite farewell message.
